{#
/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation to display a support ticket.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - support_ticket: Full support ticket entity.
 *   - id: The support ticket ID.
 *   - bundle: The type of the support ticket.
 *   - authorid: The user ID of the support ticket author.
 *   - createdtime: Time the support ticket was published formatted in Unix timestamp.
 *   - changedtime: Time the support ticket was changed formatted in Unix timestamp.
 * - label: The title of the support ticket.
 * - content: All support ticket items. Use {{ content }} to print them all,
 *   or print a subset such as {{ content.field_example }}. Use
 *   {{ content|without('field_example') }} to temporarily suppress the printing
 *   of a given child element.
 * - author_picture: The support ticket author user entity, rendered using the "compact"
 *   view mode.
 * - metadata: Metadata for this support ticket.
 * - date: Themed creation date field.
 * - author_name: Themed author name field.
 * - url: Direct URL of the current support ticket.
 * - display_submitted: Whether submission information should be displayed.
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
 *   The attributes.class element may contain one or more of the following
 *   classes:
 *   - support ticket: The current template type (also known as a "theming hook").
 *   - support ticket--type-[type]: The current support ticket type.
 *   - support-ticket--view-mode-[view_mode]: The View Mode of the support ticket; for example, a
 *     teaser would result in: "support-ticket--view-mode-teaser", and
 *     full: "support-ticket--view-mode-full".
 *   The following are controlled through the support ticket publishing options.
 *   - support-ticket--locked: Normal users can't make changes to this ticket.
 *   - support-ticket--unpublished: Appears on unpublished support tickets visible only to site
 *     admins.
 * - title_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the main title
 *   tag that appears in the template.
 * - content_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the main
 *   content tag that appears in the template.
 * - author_attributes: Same as attributes, except applied to the author of
 *   the support ticket tag that appears in the template.
 * - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - title_suffix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - view_mode: View mode; for example, "teaser" or "full".
 * - teaser: Flag for the teaser state. Will be true if view_mode is 'teaser'.
 * - page: Flag for the full page state. Will be true if view_mode is 'full'.
 * - readmore: Flag for more state. Will be true if the teaser content of the
 *   support ticket cannot hold the main body content.
 * - logged_in: Flag for authenticated user status. Will be true when the
 *   current user is a logged-in member.
 * - is_admin: Flag for admin user status. Will be true when the current user
 *   is an administrator.
 *
 * @see template_preprocess_support_ticket()
 *
 * @todo Remove the id attribute (or make it a class), because if that gets
 *   rendered twice on a page this is invalid CSS for example: two lists
 *   in different view modes.
 *
 * @ingroup themeable
